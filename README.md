Here's how searching the stock looks like:

![welcome screen](search.png "welcome screen")


The website features:

- a welcome screen, with:
  - the bookshop's information,
  - a search form,
  - a pre-selection of the books to showcase,
- a form to start searching books. A visitor can search by title, authors, publisher, shelf and ISBN(s).
- a shopping basket, for visitors to add books in
- a confirmation form, which sends the command by email to the shop owner,
- a special page to showcase a selection.

ABStock connects by default to the [Abelujo](http://abelujo.cc/)
database. Abelujo is a free software for bookshops, that manages
inventories, sells, and the like.

The database is loaded in memory at startup, doesn't access it
afterwards, and is synced several times a day.

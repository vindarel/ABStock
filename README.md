  Clients can now discover your stock and shop online.

</p>

ABStock was developed during the global lock-down to help a bookshop
keep an activity and a link with its clients. It proved 100%
useful. You can have a site on the same model.

[Install it yourself](/docs/en/install.md) or ask us. Contact us at `contact@abelujo.cc`.

The website features by default the following pages, all customizable:

- a welcome screen, with:
  - the bookshop's information,
  - a search form,
  - a pre-selection of the books to showcase,
- a form to start searching books. A visitor can search by title, authors, publisher, shelf and ISBN(s).
- a shopping basket, for visitors to add books in
- a confirmation form, which sends the command by email to the shop owner,
- a special page to showcase a selection.

Here's how searching the stock looks like:

ABStock connects by default to the [Abelujo](http://abelujo.cc/)
database. Abelujo is a free software for bookshops, that manages
inventories, sells, and the like.

The database is loaded in memory at startup, doesn't access it
afterwards, and is synced several times a day.

Interested? Please get in touch.

# v0.11, April, 202

- added **pagination** to all pages.
- fixed display order: **most recent book first**.
- added the ability to **fetch the summary of books online**, asynchronously: if `*fetch-summaries*` is `t` in `config.lisp`, try to find the book summary on an internet source.
- filter out **empty shelves** and don't display them in the select dropdown.
- changes and additions to the API to work with an external website that displays the books catalogue.
  - add a **search API**: `/api/v1/search.json?query=foo`, with a 5min cache.
- added a simple **admin page** to edit the front page texts:
  - when you start the app, it will tell you the URL, of the form `/5453ca7c-734f-5089-ad1a-b7d250f176-admin`. It is unique and re-generated at each startup, unless you save it into the config file: `(setf *admin-uuid* "uuid")` (sans the "-admin" part). You must also set an API token, see the developer documentation.
  - we use the Stylo rich text editor
  - for development: a variable allows to not use the content saved from this page: `*use-admin-custom-texts*`.
